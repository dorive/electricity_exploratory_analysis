# Analysis of the Electricity Market in Spain

This data analysis project focuses on the electricity market in Spain and covers various areas of interest, including the correlation between the Spanish, French, and Portuguese spot markets, energy demand by sources, the seasonality of energy demand, and its relationship with temperature. It utilizes data obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manualrg/spanish-electricity-market-demand-gen-price) for energy-related information and NOAA temperature data to conduct these research.

## Project Overview

The electricity market is a fundamental component of a country's energy infrastructure, and its analysis can provide valuable insights into consumption patterns, regional correlations, and environmental factors that influence demand. This project aims to better understand the electricity market in Spain from multiple perspectives.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into one Jupyter notebook. Below is a brief description of its contents:

1. **Correlation between Spot Markets**: This part analyzes the correlation between the electricity spot markets in Spain, France, and Portugal.

2. **Energy Demand by Sources**: Here, I investigate energy demand in Spain broken down by sources, including solar, wind, nuclear, photovoltaic, among others. Charts and statistics are used to visualize and comprehend the contribution of each source to the total demand.

3. **Seasonality of Energy Demand**: In this section, I explore the seasonality of energy demand throughout the year. Seasonal patterns are identified, and their implications for the electric infrastructure are discussed.

4. **Energy Demand and Temperature**: This analysis examines the relationship between energy demand and temperature variations. An scatterplot is used to determine if a significant correlation exists.

## Data Used

- **Energy Data**: Data about the Spanish electricity market was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manualrg/spanish-electricity-market-demand-gen-price). This data includes information about energy demand, generation, and spot market prices.

- **Temperature Data**: Temperature data was obtained from NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). This data was used to assess the relationship between temperature and energy demand.

## Environment Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed to run the notebooks:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy scikit-learn
   ```


## Execution

To execute the notebooks, simply open the Jupyter Notebook environment and follow the instructions provided in the code. Make sure you have the necessary data in the correct directory or adjust file paths as needed.
